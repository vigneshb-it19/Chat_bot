# Chat_bot
This project doesnâ€™t require you to do lots of coding but still gives you a fair idea of how to build chatbots in an easy way and make it public.

Dialogflow gives users new methods to interact with their product by building engaging
voice- and text-based conversational interfaces, such as voice apps and chatbots.
Dialogflow is powered by AI. It helps you connect with users on your website, mobile
app, the Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular
platforms and devices.

There is a concept of agents in Dialogflow that are best described as Natural
Language Understanding (NLU) modules. These can be included in your app, product,
or service and transform natural user requests into actionable data. This transformation
occurs when a user input matches one of the intents inside your agent.
Agents can also be designed to manage a conversation flow in a specific way. This
can be done with the help of contexts, intent priorities, slot filling, responsibilities, and
fulfillment via webhook.

In this project we learned about Dialogflow and how to use Dialogflow to build a
chatbot. We learned to define intents and their respective entities.
We built a simple food ordering chatbot that understands the order food intent from the
user and also understands what food items the user has asked for as well as the
quantity. We also enhanced our chatbot to let users ask about the status of their order
and take their order ID from them and formulate a response with different order
statuses.
We also learned about fulfillment in Dialogflow, where we pulled the status of the
order from our own API and gave the response to the user based on that. We learned to
create a web demo of our chatbot, and we also integrated our bot with Messenger.
